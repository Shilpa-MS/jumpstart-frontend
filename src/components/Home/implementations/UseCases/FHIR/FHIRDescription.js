                        Interoperable healthcare is the future and is critical
                        to improving clinical and operational workflows. Without
                        an Interoperable solution, health organizations will be
                        challenged to extract value from Clinical data to
                        realize simpler processes, efficient care, improved
                        experiences, and faster innovations. FHIR (Fast
                        Healthcare Interoperability Resources), is becoming the
                        De facto for interoperability in healthcare which
                        describes the APIs and data formats for exchanging
                        health information.
